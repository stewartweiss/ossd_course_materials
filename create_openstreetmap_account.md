# OpenStreetMap Accounts

These are instructions for creating an account in OpenStreetMaps.

1. Visit the site https://www.openstreetmap.org.
2. In the upper right corner, click the Sign Up button.
3. Complete the information required by OpenStreetMap:
    * Pick a username not like your Hunter user name
    * Use your Hunter email address.

4. When you have successfully created your account, 
    1. Go to https://pad.riseup.net/p/hccsosmaps19. 
       *RiseUp* hosts a free *Etherpad*.
        Etherpad is a software libre web application that allows for real-time group 
        collaboration of text documents. 
    1. You will see a document containing an instruction that starts,
       "For students in CS395.86, please follow the instructions..."
    1. Follow that instruction and put a line of the form
         > your_Hunter_email_address:your_OpenStreetMap_user_name
         
        in that document. Replace "your_Hunter_email_address" by your actual
        Hunter email address, and "your_OpenStreetMap_user_name" by the name you chose
        for your OpenStreetMap account.

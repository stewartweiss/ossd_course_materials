### Tuesday, January 29 Overview of Open Source and First Contributions

|                               |        |                              
|:---|:----|
|Housekeeping   | Resolve any technical issues with blog posts and user accounts, including editing blogs, markdown questions, blog content questions, and so on. |
|Discussion     | Play the video we did not play last class: |
|               |   [How to jump start a career in open source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X6HYoTl3K0) |
|               |    What is the "take-away" from this short video?
|Discussion     | How do the **Open Source Definition** and the **Free Software Definition** differ?  |
|               | What are the **four freedoms**?  Is one definition more restrictive than the other? |
| Hands-On      | OpenStreetMap editing. The class will form seven teams of three students each, with each team having exactly one "mentor" (a student who took the prequel in the fall). Who is on each team will be found in a file posted in class. The team will follow the instructions in [Editing OpenStreetMap](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/csci395.86/activities/openstreetmap_editing.pdf), found on the course webpage. |
|               | These instructions ask you to do the interactive **Learning to Edit Walkthrough**. You will not need to do that in class if your mentor remembers how to edit. If he or she does not, then the three of you can do the walkthrough together. |
|               | The goal is to make *at least five* contributions in class. If you do not, this will be part of your homework for the next class. |

### Assignment to be completed by February 1
1. If necessary, finish the OpenStreetMap editing activity on your own, or with your teammates if you choose. 
   That activity asks you to make entries in the blog. These  go into the first week blog (even if you finish them on February 1).

2. If you need to, re-watch

    * [Fleming's YouTube video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2GhS-u-5FA)

    because we will talk about the ideas he presents on Friday. 

3. Read the *Getting Started* chapter in the **Pro Git** book, skipping the section on installing Git,
   and read the second chapter, *Git Basics*, up to and including the section, *Recording Changes to the Repository*.
   If you have already read this part of the book (because you are a "mentor" in the class), then be prepared to explain this material in class on Friday.

### Assignment to be completed by **Monday evening, April 29**
1. When we return from the spring recess, we will finally discuss the origins of
open source and its history. Before that class, reread

   - [Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/) by Eric S. Raymond
   - [Producing Open Source Software](http://producingoss.com/)  by Karl Fogel

  and read
   - [Why Open Source Misses the Point of Free Software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html) by Richard Stallman

  In your blog for the week ending Thursday May 2nd, explain (in your own words)
the difference between software development following the cathedral model and
software development following the bazaar model. Having spent some time now in the
bazaar style of development, which of the two environments do you personally prefer?

2. Prepare for a short assessment to be given on Tuesday April 30th, which will
be a fifteen-minute quiz with questions about  the Unix filters presented in the
[Linux Tutorial slide set](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/csci395.86/slides/bash_tutorial_01.html),
including regular expressions. This is exclusively about filters, not the other commands.

### Assignment to be completed by Friday, February 22
1. Prepare for an Assessment.
    We will have a short (15 minute) assessment of basic git skills (through Chapter 2 of Pro Git), project anatomy and structure, key features of open source projects
    (such as what Kevin Fleming talked about, what was contained in Producing Open Source and the GitHub Guide to Contributing).

1. Continue reading the blogs of other people in the class. 
   You can go to the organization's [wiki](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr19/wiki) to see the full list of webpage URLs.
   If you find any problems or improvements to suggest, such as configuration, formatting, factual errors, and so on,  report these as issues in the person's blog repository and
   add the list of reported issues to the list of contributions on your own blog (make the link to the issue you reported).

1. For your blog for the week ending Thursday February 21,   comment on your experience with the project evaluation assignment. For example, was it useful? Was it very time-consuming? 
     How would you assess the activity level of a project? Can you propose other ways of doing this? Try to back up your ideas with some 
     reasons.

### Background Reading for Tuesday February 26
  - Those people who have never read it should now read [ The Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html)
  This is especially important for those who want to embark on a new project with a group of developers.

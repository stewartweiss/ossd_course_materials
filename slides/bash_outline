## Environment Variables and the User Environment
- UNIX keeps track of your actions by saving various items of information about you in specially named variables called environment variables.
A variable is just like a mathematical variable â€“ it is a symbol that can have a single value at any time. In UNIX, variables are named using ordinary words;  environment variables are usually in all UPPERCASE.
	The collection of environment variables and their values is called your environment.

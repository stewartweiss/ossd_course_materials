### Assignment to be completed by **Monday evening, March 11**
1. In preparation for the presentation and classroom visit by Patrick Masson,
   General Manager of the Board of Directors of the **Open Source Initiative**,
   take a look at his [Linked-In Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-masson-4a09b53/),
   and refresh your memory about [OSI](https://opensource.org/). Then,  knowing that
   he will talk about "Working in Open Source": how people and organizations in open
   source work effectively (skills, teams, communications, etc) and differently
   from proprietary shops,
   add a question in the organization's wiki: [Questions for Patrick Masson](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr19/wiki/wiki/Questions-for-Patrick-Masson).
   Instructions for contributing to the wiki are in the wiki itself in the Home page.



2. In your weekly blog, update what you have done so far with the three issues that
   you identified in the previous week's blog post.

### Assignments to be completed by **Monday evening, March 4**
1. Because on Friday, March 1, the class will not meet, 
   your assignment for that time slot is to watch the YouTube video
   [A Crash Course in Open Source Licensing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJIi-hIlCQM&feature=youtu.be)
   by Kevin Fleming. It is one and one-half hours long, so you might need to watch it in more than one sitting.
   In your blog for the week ending March 6, explain your understanding of what a copyright is, what a patent is,
   and what the purpose of a software license is.  Explain how copyright works when people contribute to projects.
   What is the role of ketchup in this talk? Summarize the major points of this presentation.
   

1. Put your choice of project to work on into the
   [Class wiki page](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr19/wiki/wiki/Semester-Project-Groups).
   Final decisions and commitments must be made so that on Tuesday, we can organize the teams.

1. Make sure that the team project evaluation activity is complete.

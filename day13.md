### Assignment to be completed by **Thursday evening, March 14**
1. We will have a short assessment at the start of class on Friday March 15.
   The topics will be
   - licenses, copyright, and intellectual property rights, to the extent that you 
   learned about them from Kevin Fleming's talk and the content of the readings you have
   been asked to do so far, and
   - Mozilla and the Internet, as explained by Christos Bacharakis during his visit. 



2. In your weekly blog, update what you have done so far on your project- give details.
   Also add any comments or thoughts about things you learned from Patrick Masson's talk.

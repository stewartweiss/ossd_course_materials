### Assignment to be completed by **Monday evening, April 1**
1. Next week we will discuss Wikipedia, and your goal will be to make contributions in the form of edits.
Therefore, as a start, it is time to read [Contributing to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contributing_to_Wikipedia#Getting_started)
and [A Primer for Newcomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:A_primer_for_newcomers). This is just a start. It is important to know about the
Discussion pages, formally called **Talk** pages, but reading about them can wait a few days. If you are interested to read about them start
with [Help:Talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Talk_pages).

2. Rummage around in Wikipedia looking for pages that you think you might be able to edit. In your weekly blog, write about what you find, or
what you discovered and what was hard. In addition,  update your progress on the issues you have isolated in your project.

# Wikipedia Accounts

We will spend some time editing Wikipedia pages, and while an account is not
absolutely necessary for this, I am requiring that you create one.
These are instructions for creating an account in Wikipedia.

1. Visit any Wikipedia page. E.g., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page
2. In the upper right corner, click the Create Account link.
3. Complete the information required on the page that loads. It is very self-explanatory:
    * Pick a username not like your Hunter user name. You can use the same name
    that you chose for GitHub and OpenStreetMap
    * Use your Hunter email address.
    * Click the Create Your Account button at the bottom of the page.

4. When you have successfully created your account, 
    1. Go to https://pad.riseup.net/p/hccswikiaccts. 
    1. You will see a document containing an instruction that starts,
       "For students in CS395.86, please follow the instructions..."
    1. Follow that instruction and put a line of the form
         > your_Hunter_email_address:your_Wikipedia_user_name
         
        in that document. Replace "your_Hunter_email_address" by your actual
        Hunter email address, and "your_Wikipedia_user_name" by the name you chose
        for your Wikipedia account.

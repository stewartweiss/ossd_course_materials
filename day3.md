### Assignment to be completed by Tuesday, February 5
1. Background Reading:

    * Everyone who has not read it, must read Chapter 2 of [Producing Open Source Software](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
2. Technical Reading (for those taking the course for the first time):
    * Read the rest of the *Git Basics* chapter in the [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2), after the section, *Recording Changes to the Repository*
      and read the beginning of *Git Branching* through the end of *Branching and Merging*. All together these are pages 48 to 69.
      You may "skim" the sections on customizing the output of the log in the section on Viewing the Commit History.

3. For mentors only:
    * Each mentor will prepare a five to ten minute overview of he project that he or she worked on in the fall and what the outcome was, with visuals as needed.
      The order of presentations will be decided on Tuesday, but one person needs to commit to present on Tuesday.

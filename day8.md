### Assignment to be completed by Tuesday, February 26
1. Since Christos Bacharakis, from Mozilla, will be talking to the class next Tuesday, your first assignment is to
   add a question in the organization's wiki: [Questions for Christos ](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr19/wiki/wiki/Questions-for-Christos-Bacharakis)
   Take a look at  [Christos's LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christosbaharakis/?originalSubdomain=gr).
   Instructions for contributing to the wiki are in the wiki itself in the *Contributing To This Wiki* document.

1. It is time to narrow down the search for a project to which you want to contribute. People who are not interested in the Open
   Source NYC project should prepare before Tuesday by investigating which projects they are interested in, and they should come up with a list of at most three projects.
   Put your ideas about this into your blog for the week ending Thursday February 28.
   The people who want to work on the Open Source NYC project must do some preliminary work:
     - Look up [24 Pull Requests](https://24pullrequests.com/) and [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).
       These are both websites that need to pull down GitHub statistics and there is a chance that much can be re-used from their *open source* repositories.

     - Assess your strengths and weaknesses and make some decisions about what role(s) in the project you would consider. For example,
       are you interested in coding the back-end, the web  interface, writing documentation, designing the visuals, managing the group, being a maintainer?
       Put your ideas about this into your blog for the week ending Thursday February 28.

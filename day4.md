### Assignment to be completed by Friday, February 8
1. Background Reading:
    * Read [GitHub's How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/), through the end of Section 4. This is very  important reading! I will be asking you very soon to evaluate a few open source projects based on the criteria in the guide.
2. Technical Reading :
    * Read the rest of the *Git Branching* chapter in the [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2), up to but not including *Rebasing*, which starts on page 80.
      If you need to reread the earlier part of this chapter, this is a good time to do so. 
3. For your blog for the week ending Thursday February 7, answer the following questions. 
     * What do you think should be your first contributions to an open source project? Bear in mind the various ways that someone can contribute, and refer back to the webpages that discussed this if you need to.
     * What kind of project would be your ideal project to support? For example, a humanitarian project, a game engine, a part of a big application like Gnome or Firefox? 
    Try to be realistic; given how much time you have during this semester, what is your goal?

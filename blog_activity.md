# Weekly Journal/Blog
Every student will maintain a journal for this class. Writing a journal is
a way to improve your communication skills. The journal also serves as a record of 
what you have accomplished in this class. We will use a blog as the medium for these
journal entries.
You will be given a **public** repository for this course-related blog.
The fact that it is public implies that anyone in the world can read what is
put into this blog. The exact instructions for how to set up the blog are in the
README.md file in the blog repository on GitHub that is created for you.
The blog template is in the class organization at 

`https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr19/weekly`

Your individual blog is named 

`https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr19/gh-username-weekly`
    
where `gh-username`  is your GitHub account name. Because GitHub-pages has been 
activated for this repository, you will also have a webpage at the URL

    https://hunter-college-cs-ossd.github.io/gh-username-weekly/

**Each week, by Thursday night, a new post should be added to the blog for the
week ending that day.** For example, the first day of classes is Friday, January 25,
so the first week is from January 25 through January 31.
The blog post for the week should be based on the following conditions:

* If an assignment was given that specifically asked for something to be written
    in the blog for the week, then the post for the week should include whatever\
    was requested in the assignment.
* Whether or not anything was assigned, the post for that week should include
      a summary of all course-related activity.
* If you have made any contributions of any kind, whether they are to 
  *OpenStreetMap*, *Wikipedia*, or any software project, the post should
   include a list of those contributions.

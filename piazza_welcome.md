I am looking forward to teaching and working with you this semester, and I 
would like to ask you to do a few things before the first day of class, 
which is this coming Friday, so that we have a more productive first few classes. 

You will need a *GitHub *account, an *OpenStreetMaps* account, and a *Wikipedia* 
account. The instructions for setting up the GitHub account are below.
After I have everyone's GitHub account informaation, I will send instructions
for setting up the other two accounts.

## Creating GitHub Accounts

These are the instructions for creating your GitHub account for the class.

Because the account will be used for class, and because your repositories
will be public and will be part of your academic evaluation, there is the
potential that this would violate FERPA. The solution is that you should
choose a user name that is not the same as your Hunter College user name.

If you already have a GitHub account and you are satisfied with the name
of the account, you still have to do step 2 but you can skip step 1.


1. Go to https://github.com. There, do the following:
    1. Set up a free user account:
        1. Choose a user name that isn’t already taken, provide an email address
    and a password, and click the big green “Sign up for GitHub” button.    
        1. The next thing you’ll see is the pricing page for upgraded plans,
    but you can ignore this for now.
        1. GitHub will send you an email to verify the address you provided.
        1. Follow their instructions.
    2. That is all for now. We will return to using GitHub later.

2. When you have successfully created your account, 
    1. Go to https://pad.riseup.net/p/hccsossds19. 
       *RiseUp* hosts a free *Etherpad*.
        Etherpad is a software libre web application that allows for real-time group 
        collaboration of text documents. 
    1. You will see a document containing an instruction that starts,
       "For students in CS395.86, please follow the instructions..."
    1. Follow that instruction and put a line of the form
         > your_Hunter_email_address:your_GitHub_user_name
         
        in that document. Replace "your_Hunter_email_address" by your actual
        Hunter email address, and "your_GitHub_user_name" by the name you chose
        for your GitHub user name.

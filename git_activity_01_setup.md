### Organization

Students will be organized into teams of three or four students each. It is better if team members do not sit near each other, to reduce communication that defeats a purpose of the exercise. 

Before starting the activity, assign each student to a team and assign each
student a role in the team.  The teams will be identified by some *handle*, 
such as an icon, image, or avatar. Each student on the team has a role identified by one of four colors or numbers, 1 through 4, and colors red, green, blue, yellow respectively.

If the number of students present is not a multiple of four, then divide the 
group into teams of size three and four as needed.  

### Setup

Create an empty repository for each team in the class organization on GitHub. 
The students should have permissions to write to these repositories.

The organization settings must allow members to be able to fork private repositories. This is not enabled by default and must be enabled in the organization settings.

The students must be told prior to starting this activity that they must make sure they:
1. know their GitHub usernames and passwords, or have set up their ssh key-pairs, 
2. have run `git config --global` to set both user name and email.

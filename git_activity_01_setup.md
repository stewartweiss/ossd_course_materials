### Organization

Students will be organized into teams of three or four students each. It is better if 
team members do not sit near each other, to reduce communication that defeats 
a purpose of the exercise. 

Before starting the activity, assign each student to a team and assign each
student a role in the team.  The teams will be identified by some *handle*, 
such as an icon, image, or avatar. Each student on the team has a role identified
by one of four colors or numbers, 1 through 4, and colors red, green, blue, yellow
respectively.

If the number of students present is not a multiple of four, then divide the 
group into teams of size three and four as needed.  

### Setup

Create an empty repository for each team in the class organization on GitHub. 
The students should have permissions to write to these repositories.

### Assignment to be completed by Tuesday, February 19
1. Background Reading:
   - [Four Types of Open Source Communities](https://opensource.com/business/13/6/four-types-organizational-structures-within-open-source-communities)
   - [The Beginner's Guide to Contributing to Open Source Projects](https://blog.newrelic.com/engineering/open-source_gettingstarted/ )
   - [7 Things That Make a Great Open Source Contribution](https://blog.newrelic.com/2014/11/05/open-source-contribution/) 

1. Start reading the blogs of other people in the class. They are public and anyone can read them. Be sure to read the webpage versions of
   them.
   You can go to the organization's [wiki](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr19/wiki) to see the full list of webpage URLs.
   If you find any problems or improvements to suggest, such as configuration, formatting, factual errors, and so on,  report these as issues in the person's blog repository and
   add the list of reported issues to the list of contributions on your own blog (make the link to the issue you reported)
1. For your blog for the week ending Thursday February 21,   comment on your experience with the project evaluation assignment. For example, was it useful? Was it very time-consuming? 
     How would you assess the activity level of a project? Can you propose other ways of doing this? Try to back up your ideas with some 
     reasons.

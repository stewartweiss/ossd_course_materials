### Assignment to be completed by **Monday evening, April 15**
1. Make at least two non-trivial edits to one or more Wikipedia pages. In your blog, post the URLs of
the pages in which you made the edits and describe how you decided on which edits to make.
A trivial edit is correcting a spelling mistake or a typo. Non-trivial edits include
fixing citations and bar eURLs, content changes, grammar changes.

 The goal is to make at least five edits before the end of the semester, but for
Tuesday two are a start.
